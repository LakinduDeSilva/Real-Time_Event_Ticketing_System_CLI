# Real-Time Event Ticketing System CLI

## üìñ Project Description
A command-line interface (CLI) application designed to simulate a real-time ticketing environment using advanced multi-threading and the producer-consumer pattern. This system focuses on managing concurrent ticket releases and purchases while ensuring data integrity in a multi-threaded environment.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Concurrent Ticket Management**: Handles multiple vendors (producers) and customers (consumers) simultaneously.
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Ensures proper synchronization to prevent race conditions and deadlocks.
- **Customizable Configuration**: Allows users to set parameters like ticket release rates and maximum capacity.
- **Real-Time Logging**: Displays system activities, such as ticket additions and purchases.
- **JSON-Based Configuration**: Uses Google Gson libraries for configuration management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Java**: The primary programming language.
- **Google Gson**: For handling JSON-based configuration.
- **Multi-threading**: Utilized for concurrent ticket management.
- **Producer-Consumer Pattern**: To efficiently manage the flow of tickets between vendors and customers.
